# Project Workflow

## Guiding Principles

1. **The Plan is the Source of Truth:** All work must be tracked in `plan.md`
2. **The Status is Always Current:** `status.md` must be updated at the end of every work session
3. **The Architecture is Deliberate:** Changes to the system design must be documented in `architecture.md` *before* implementation
4. **Test-Driven Development:** Write unit tests before implementing functionality
5. **High Code Coverage:** Aim for >80% code coverage for all modules
6. **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict lifecycle:

### Standard Task Workflow

1. **Select Task:** Choose the next available task from `plan.md` in sequential order

2. **Mark In Progress:** Before beginning work, edit `plan.md` and change the task from `[ ]` to `[~]`

3. **Write Tests First:** For each task:
   - Write unit tests that define expected behavior
   - Ensure tests fail initially (red phase)
   - Implement code to make tests pass (green phase)
   - Refactor while keeping tests green (refactor phase)

4. **Implement:** Perform the work required following TDD principles

5. **Verify Coverage:** Run coverage reports using the project's chosen tools. For example, in a Python project, this might look like:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
   ```
   Target: >80% coverage for new code. The specific tools and commands will vary by language and framework.

6. **Document Deviations:** If implementation differs from architecture:
   - **STOP** implementation
   - Update `architecture.md` with new design
   - Add dated note explaining the change
   - Resume implementation

7. **Commit Code Changes:**
   - Stage all code changes related to the task.
   - Propose a clear, concise commit message following the prose style guide.
   - Perform the commit.

8. **Create dev_log.md entry:**
   - Obtain the hash of the *just-completed commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`).
   - Create a detailed entry in the development log for the completed task, referencing the commit hash.
   - Append the entry to `dev_log.md`.
   - Stage `dev_log.md`.
   - Propose a commit message for the `dev_log.md` update (e.g., "chore(dev_log): Add entry for [Task Name]").
   - Perform the commit.


### Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage meets requirements (>80%)
- [ ] Code follows project's code style guidelines (as defined in `code_styleguides/`)
- [ ] All public functions/methods are documented (e.g., docstrings, JSDoc, GoDoc)
- [ ] Type safety is enforced (e.g., type hints, TypeScript types, Go types)
- [ ] No linting or static analysis errors (using the project's configured tools)
- [ ] Works correctly on mobile (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

## Development Commands

**AI AGENT INSTRUCTION: This section should be adapted to the project's specific language, framework, and build tools.**

### Setup
```bash
# Example: Commands to set up the development environment (e.g., install dependencies, configure database)
# e.g., for a Node.js project: npm install
# e.g., for a Go project: go mod tidy
```

### Daily Development
```bash
# Example: Commands for common daily tasks (e.g., start dev server, run tests, lint, format)
# e.g., for a Node.js project: npm run dev, npm test, npm run lint
# e.g., for a Go project: go run main.go, go test ./..., go fmt ./...
```

### Before Committing
```bash
# Example: Commands to run all pre-commit checks (e.g., format, lint, type check, run tests)
# e.g., for a Node.js project: npm run check
# e.g., for a Go project: make check (if a Makefile exists)
```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- Every module must have corresponding tests.
- Use appropriate test setup/teardown mechanisms (e.g., fixtures, beforeEach/afterEach).
- Mock external dependencies.
- Test both success and failure cases.

### Integration Testing
- Test complete user flows
- Verify database transactions
- Test authentication and authorization
- Check form submissions

### Mobile Testing
- Test on actual iPhone when possible
- Use Safari developer tools
- Test touch interactions
- Verify responsive layouts
- Check performance on 3G/4G

## Code Review Process

### Self-Review Checklist
Before requesting review:

1. **Functionality**
   - Feature works as specified
   - Edge cases handled
   - Error messages are user-friendly

2. **Code Quality**
   - Follows style guide
   - DRY principle applied
   - Clear variable/function names
   - Appropriate comments

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests comprehensive
   - Integration tests pass
   - Coverage adequate (>80%)

4. **Security**
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Input validation present
   - SQL injection prevented
   - XSS protection in place

5. **Performance**
   - Database queries optimized
   - Images optimized
   - Caching implemented where needed

6. **Mobile Experience**
   - Touch targets adequate (44x44px)
   - Text readable without zooming
   - Performance acceptable on mobile
   - Interactions feel native

## Status Update Workflow

At the end of **every work session**:

1. Update `status.md` with:
   - Current date/time
   - Project status
   - Current phase and task
   - Next action needed
   - Any blockers
   - Session notes

2. Commit all changes with descriptive message

3. Push to feature branch

## Commit Guidelines

### Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): Add remember me functionality"
git commit -m "fix(posts): Correct excerpt generation for short posts"
git commit -m "test(comments): Add tests for emoji reaction limits"
git commit -m "style(mobile): Improve button touch targets"
```

7. Implementation notes added to `plan.md`
8. `status.md` updated
9. Changes committed with proper message
10. `dev_log.md` entry created and committed
