## Core Voice: "The Warm Companion"

All text in this application should feel like a warm, personal conversation between loved ones. The tone is intimate without being overly familiar, clear without being cold, and helpful without being patronizing.

## Voice Principles

### DO:
- Use warm, welcoming language
- Be clear and direct
- Use personal pronouns ("your posts", "Bob's comments")
- Keep messages brief and meaningful
- Use gentle encouragement for actions
- Acknowledge the personal nature of the content

### DON'T:
- Use technical jargon
- Be overly formal or corporate
- Use exclamation points excessively
- Make assumptions about emotions
- Use generic error messages
- Include unnecessary explanations

## UI Text Examples

### Good Examples:
- "Welcome back, Bob"
- "Keith shared a new letter"
- "Add your thoughts"
- "This letter has been saved"
- "Something went wrong. Try again?"

### Poor Examples:
- "User authentication successful!"
- "Post ID #4521 has been created"
- "Error 403: Access Denied"
- "Submit your comment data"
- "System notification: New content available"
