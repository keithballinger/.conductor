# The Professional Prose Style Guide

## Core Voice: "Clear, Trustworthy, and Precise"

All text in this project should convey professionalism, accuracy, and reliability. The tone is respectful, formal but approachable, and prioritizes clarity and factual correctness.

## Voice Principles

### DO:
- Use clear, unambiguous language.
- Maintain a respectful and objective tone.
- Prioritize factual accuracy and precision.
- Use standard terminology consistently.
- Provide necessary context without being verbose.

### DON'T:
- Use slang, jargon (unless defined and necessary for the audience), or overly casual language.
- Be overly emotional or subjective.
- Use excessive exclamation points or emojis.
- Make assumptions about user knowledge without providing explanations.
- Use humor that might not translate or be universally understood.

## UI Text Examples

### Good Examples:
- "Welcome to the dashboard."
- "Your account balance is $1,234.56."
- "Confirm action: Delete selected item?"
- "Data successfully saved."
- "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again."

### Poor Examples:
- "Hey there, champ! Ready to rock?"
- "OMG, your balance is HUGE!"
- "Are you SURE you wanna delete this? LOL."
- "Whoopsie! Something broke."
- "System notification: New stuff happened."

## Commit Message Guidelines

- **Format:** Follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat(auth): Add multi-factor authentication`).
- **Subject Line:** Concise, imperative mood, 50 characters max.
- **Body:** Explain *why* the change was made and *what* problem it solves.
- **Tone:** Objective and factual.
