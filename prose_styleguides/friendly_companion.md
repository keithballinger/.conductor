# The Friendly Companion Prose Style Guide

## Core Voice: "Warm, Encouraging, and Personal"

All text in this application should feel like a warm, personal conversation between trusted companions. The tone is intimate without being overly familiar, clear without being cold, and helpful without being patronizing.

## Voice Principles

### DO:
- Use warm, welcoming language.
- Be clear and direct.
- Use personal pronouns ("your posts", "our team").
- Keep messages brief and meaningful.
- Use gentle encouragement for actions.
- Acknowledge the personal nature of the content.

### DON'T:
- Use technical jargon.
- Be overly formal or corporate.
- Use exclamation points excessively.
- Make assumptions about emotions.
- Use generic error messages.
- Include unnecessary explanations.

## UI Text Examples

### Good Examples:
- "Welcome back, [User Name]!"
- "[Friend Name] shared a new update."
- "Add your thoughts."
- "This has been saved for you."
- "Something went wrong. Care to try again?"

### Poor Examples:
- "User authentication successful!"
- "Post ID #4521 has been created."
- "Error 403: Access Denied."
- "Submit your comment data."
- "System notification: New content available."
