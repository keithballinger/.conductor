# AI AGENT PROTOCOL: The Conductor Methodology
**Version: 2.0**

## 1.0 SYSTEM DIRECTIVE
You are an AI agent. Your primary function is to set up and manage a software project using the Conductor methodology. This document is your operational protocol. Adhere to these instructions precisely and sequentially. Do not make assumptions.

---

## 2.0 PHASE 1: STREAMLINED PROJECT SETUP
**PROTOCOL: Follow this sequence to perform a guided, interactive setup with the user.**

### 2.0 Initialize Git Repository
1.  **Announce Action:** Inform the user that you will check for a Git repository.
2.  **Check and Execute:**
    -   Check for the existence of a `.git` directory in the project root.
    -   If a `.git` directory does not exist, execute the `git init` command.
    -   Report to the user that a new Git repository has been initialized.
    -   If a `.git` directory already exists, report to the user that an existing repository was found.
4.  **Continue:** Immediately proceed to the next section.

### 2.1 Execute Initial Scaffolding Commands
1.  **Announce Action:** Inform the user that you will begin by setting up the project's directory structure and fetching the style guide catalogs.
2.  **Execute Commands:** Execute the following shell commands precisely and in order:
    -   `mkdir -p .conductor/code_styleguides .conductor/prose_styleguides .conductor/workflows`
    -   `curl -o .conductor/code_styleguides/toc.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithballinger/.conductor/refs/heads/main/code_styleguides/toc.md`
    -   `curl -o .conductor/prose_styleguides/toc.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithballinger/.conductor/refs/heads/main/prose_styleguides/toc.md`
    -   `curl -o .conductor/workflows/toc.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithballinger/.conductor/refs/heads/main/workflows/toc.md`
    -   `curl -o .conductor/prompt.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithballinger/.conductor/refs/heads/main/prompt.md`
3.  **Continue:** After executing all commands, immediately proceed to the next section.

### 2.2 Guided Selection (Interactive Dialogue)
1.  **Initiate Dialogue:** Announce that the initial scaffolding is complete and you now need the user's input to select the project's guides.

2.  **Select Code Style Guides:**
    -   Read and parse `.conductor/code_styleguides/toc.md`.
    -   **Output the following JSON block directly in your response (do not use a shell command to print it):**
        ```json
        {
            "title": "Code Styleguide",
            "multi_select": true,
            "guides": [
                { "name": "{name of styleguide}" }
            ]
        }
        ```
    -   **STOP and WAIT** for the user to reply with their selection.
    -   For each file the user selects, you **MUST** construct and execute a `curl` command to download it. For example, to download `python.md`, execute: `curl -o .conductor/code_styleguides/python.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithballinger/.conductor/refs/heads/main/code_styleguides/python.md`

3.  **Select Prose Style Guide:**
    -   Read and parse `.conductor/prose_styleguides/toc.md`.
    -   **Output the following JSON block directly in your response (do not use a shell command to print it):**
        ```json
        {
            "title": "Prose Styleguide",
            "multi_select": false,
            "guides": [
                { "name": "{name of styleguide}" }
            ]
        }
        ```
    -   **STOP and WAIT** for the user to reply with their selection.
    -   You **MUST** construct and execute a `curl` command to download the selected file into the `.conductor/prose_styleguides/` directory.

4.  **Select Workflow:**
    -   Read and parse `.conductor/workflows/toc.md`.
    -   **Output the following JSON block directly in your response (do not use a shell command to print it):**
        ```json
        {
            "title": "Workflow",
            "multi_select": false,
            "guides": [
                { "name": "{name of workflow}" }
            ]
        }
        ```
    -   **STOP and WAIT** for the user to reply with their selection.
    -   You **MUST** construct and execute a `curl` command to download the selected file into the `.conductor/workflows/` directory.

### 2.3 Finalization and Execution
1.  **Summarize and Execute:** After the user has made their selections, present a summary of all the actions you are about to take. The summary must include:
    -   A list of all the guide files that will be downloaded.
    -   A list of all the empty core files that will be created: `.conductor/plan.md`, `.conductor/status.md`, `.conductor/user_guide.md`, and `.conductor/architecture.md`.
2.  **Execute Actions:** Immediately execute all the summarized actions:
    -   Download all the selected guide files.
    -   Create all the empty core files, ensuring they are placed inside the `.conductor/` directory.
3.  **Transition to Phase 2:** Announce that Phase 1 is complete and you will now proceed to Phase 2 to begin the collaborative project definition, starting with the `user_guide.md`.

---

## 3.0 PHASE 2: COLLABORATIVE PROJECT DEFINITION
**PROTOCOL: After setup, your next task is to define the project specifications collaboratively with the user. Follow this sequence precisely.**

### 3.1 Generate User Guide (Interactive)
1.  **State Your Goal:** Announce that you will now help the user create the `user_guide.md`.
2.  **Provide an Overview:** List the topics you plan to ask about (e.g., users, goals, features).
3.  **Ask Questions Sequentially:** Ask your first question. **STOP** and wait for the user's response. Then, ask the next question. Continue this until you have enough information.
4.  **Draft the Document:** Once the dialogue is complete, generate the content for `user_guide.md`.
5.  **Write File:** Write the generated content to the `.conductor/user_guide.md` file.
6.  **Continue:** After writing the file, immediately proceed to the next section.

### 3.2 Generate Technical Architecture (Interactive)
1.  **State Your Goal:** After `user_guide.md` is approved, announce that you will now help the user create the `architecture.md`.
2.  **Provide an Overview:** List the architectural decisions you need to confirm (e.g., language, framework, database).
3.  **Ask Questions Sequentially:** Ask your first question. **STOP** and wait for the user's response. Then, ask the next question. Continue this until the technical direction is clear.
4.  **Generate the Document:** Once the dialogue is complete, generate the content for `architecture.md`.
5.  **Write File:** Write the generated content to the `.conductor/architecture.md` file.
6.  **Continue:** After writing the file, immediately proceed to the next section.

### 3.3 Generate Project Plan (Automated + Approval)
1.  **State Your Goal:** After `architecture.md` is approved, announce that you will now generate the project plan.
2.  **Analyze Documents:** Read the final, user-approved `user_guide.md` and `architecture.md`.
3.  **Generate Plan:** Based on your analysis, create a highly detailed project plan in `plan.md`. The plan must include a hierarchical structure of phases and tasks. **CRITICAL:** The structure of the tasks must adhere to the principles outlined in the selected workflow file. For example, if the workflow specifies Test-Driven Development, each feature task must be broken down into a "Write Tests" sub-task followed by an "Implement Feature" sub-task.
4.  **Write File:** Write the generated content to the `.conductor/plan.md` file.
5.  Announce that Phase 2 is complete and you are ready for daily development work.
6.  **Transition to Development:** To complete the transition, announce that you will now read the `prompt.md` file to begin the first development session. Then, without waiting for a response, execute the instructions within `prompt.md`.

### 3.4 Attach Task Summary using Git Notes
1.  **State Your Goal:** After the task's code changes are committed and all checks have passed, announce that you will now attach a task summary to the commit using git notes.
2.  **Obtain Git Commit Hash of Work:**
    -   Execute the shell command: `git log -1 --format="%H"` (This gets the hash of the *last commit*, which should be the one containing the task's code changes).
    -   Store the returned commit hash.
3.  **Gather Information:** Collect the task name, a summary of the changes, a list of all created/modified files, and the core "why" for the change. This information will form the body of the note.
4.  **Attach Note:** Execute the `git notes add` command to attach the information as a note to the commit hash.
    - `git notes add -m "<note_content>" <commit_hash>`
5.  Announce that the task is fully complete.

---

## 4.0 PHASE 3: DAILY DEVELOPMENT CYCLE
**PROTOCOL: This is the protocol for executing development tasks. It is initiated by the user invoking you with `prompt.md`.**

1.  **Context Assimilation:** On session start, execute the instructions in `prompt.md`.
2.  **Receive Task:** Await the user's command to begin a specific task from `plan.md`.
3.  **EXECUTE WORKFLOW:** For the given task, you **MUST** follow the step-by-step instructions outlined in the selected workflow file (e.g., `standard_team.md`) precisely. This is your primary operational protocol for development. This includes, but is not limited to:
    -   Marking the task as in-progress in `plan.md`.
    -   Writing tests *before* writing implementation code (TDD).
    -   Running all quality gates and checks.
    -   Committing the work with an appropriate message.
    -   Creating the git note for the work.
4.  **Report Completion:** Announce that the task is complete and that you have followed all steps in the workflow, including creating the dev log entry.
