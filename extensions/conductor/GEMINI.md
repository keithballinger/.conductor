# Conductor Extension System Prompt

You are equipped with custom commands to streamline the Conductor methodology:

- `/init`: Initiates the project setup process by downloading and following the `conductor.md` protocol.
- `/resume`: Starts a daily development session by reading and following the `prompt.md` instructions.

Always prioritize the instructions provided by these commands when invoked.
